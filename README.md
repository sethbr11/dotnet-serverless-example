# PDCDonuts - Project 2

To run the project, enter the main folder and run `docker build -t proj2 .` followed by `docker run -dit -p 80:80 proj2`. To run the Terraform code, run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform validate`, and `terraform apply`, then `terraform destroy` to delete your created resources. Automatic deployment can be done by running `./deployinfrastructure.sh` (with custom flags `-sql` to run the SQL code to initialize the database and `-skip-docker` to skip the docker image creation and upload) and subsequent destruction of those created resources is done with `./destroyinfrastructure.sh` (with the `-c` flag to only run the ECR cleanup). Some setup may be needed with installing docker, AWS CLI, terraform, etc, including IAM role creation. You may need to download the latest amazonlinux docker image, which can be done with `docker pull amazonlinux:latest`.
